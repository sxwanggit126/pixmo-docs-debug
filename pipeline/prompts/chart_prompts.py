Please come up with a list of *reasonable questions* that people will ask when they see the rendered figure. Here are the requirements:
1. **Question Style**: The questions must be natural and related to the figure, which can help interpret the data and understand the insights.
    (1) The questions vary in complexity. Some are easy to answer by just referring to the figure, and some are challenging and require multiple-step reasoning.
    (2) The questions should be answerable based on the *visual information* in the figure. Don't include any coding details in the questions since this type of information is not visible in the figure.

2. **Question Types**: Most questions are short-answer, but some can be multiple-choice, yes/no, or summary questions. You can use the following types:
    (1) Short-answer: At least 5 short-answer questions.
    (2) Multiple-choice: There should be at least two multiple-choice questions. The number of options can be 3, 4, 5, or more. The option labels can be different types: alphabet, Arabic numerals, or Roman numerals. The correct option should be different in each question.
    (3) Yes/No (True/False): At least 1 binary question.
    (4) Summary: At least 1 summary question that asks for describing the *entire figure* or writing a caption for the figure.

4. **Response Format**: separate the question, answer, and explanation with a | character: question | answer | explanation. The question-answer pairs should be separated by double newlines (\n\n).
For example:
what's the difference between A and B? | 15 | A is 10 and B is 25, so the difference is 25-10=15

Which group has the highest value? A. Group-1 B. Group-2 C. Group-3 | B | Group-1 is 20, Group-2 is 25, and Group-3 is 15, so Group-2 has the highest value.

2. **Question Types**: All questions should be short-answer questions that are answerable based on the visual information in the figure.
    (1) **Basic questions** ask for basic elements in the figure such as visual appearance, title, axis, ticks, colors, number of data points, etc. Remeber to use **natural language** when referring to these elements, do not use coding terms (RGB, HEX, etc.).
    (2) **Compositional questions** contain at least two mathematical/logical operations like sum, difference, and average, e.g., "What's the median value of group A?". Generate questions using different numbers and types of operations.
    (3) **Comparison questions** ask about the relationship between two or more data points, e.g., "Which group has the highest value?". Generate questions using different comparison operators (greater than, less than, equal to, etc.) and data points.

Please define a Python function (using `matplotlib`) called `generate_plot` that generates a {figure_type} using the data provided. Here are the requirements:
1. **Style Requirements**:
    (1) Try to be creative and change the arguments (e.g., font, color, marker, etc) to make the plot look unique. Set the style by using `plt.style.use('{style_name}')`.
    (2) Consider the **scale of data** to select the appropriate design scale (axis range, figure size, font/marker size, etc) to ensure the information in the plot is clear and easy to understand, with no text overlapping etc.

2. **Code Requirements**: create a function called `generate_plot` that generates the chart using `matplotlib`.
    (1) The data, which is loaded as a pd.DataFrame is provided as the first argument for the function. The function has no other arguments. You may need to adjust the data format or hard code some data to fit the `matplotlib` specification.
    (2) Remember to import necessary libraries (e.g., `import numpy as np`, `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`) at the beginning of the script.
    (3) The `generate_plot` function should save the plot to a BytesIO and then return the plot as a PIL Image object. **Do not close the BytesIO object.**
    (4) Use `bbox_inches='tight'` argument in `savefig` or `plt.tight_layout()`, ensuring the plot is saved with all the elements (title, labels, etc) visible.
    (5) Only define the function and do not call it. Do not show the plot. Save the plot with appropriate resolution. No need to show example usage.

3. **Output Requirements**:
    Put ```python at the beginning and ``` at the end of the script to separate the code from the text. This will help me easily extract the code.

2. **Code Requirements**: create a function called `generate_plot` that generates the chart using `plotly`. Do not use matplotlib or other libraries.
    (1) The data, which is loaded as a pd.DataFrame is provided as the first argument for the function. The function has no other arguments. You may need to adjust the data format to fit the `plotly` specification.
    (2) Remember to import necessary libraries at the beginning of the script. You must import: `import plotly.graph_objects as go`, `import plotly.express as px`, `from PIL import Image`, `from io import BytesIO`
    (3) The `generate_plot` function should convert the plotly figure to a PIL Image and return it. Use this pattern with error handling:
        ```
        # Convert to static image with fallback
        try:
            img_bytes = fig.to_image(format='png', width=800, height=600, scale=2)

            img_buf.seek(0)
            return Image.open(img_buf)
        ```
    (4) IMPORTANT: For Candlestick charts, use 'hovertext' instead of 'hovertemplate'. The 'hovertemplate' property is not supported.
    (5) Select appropriate margins and tight layout. Use fig.update_layout(margin=dict(l=50, r=50, t=50, b=50)) if needed.
    (6) Only define the function and do not call it. No need to show example usage.

3. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
    - Do NOT use 'hovertemplate' with go.Candlestick - use 'hovertext' instead
    - Do NOT use fig.write_image() - use fig.to_image() instead
    - Do NOT close the BytesIO object
    - Do NOT use plotly.offline or plotly.io functions
