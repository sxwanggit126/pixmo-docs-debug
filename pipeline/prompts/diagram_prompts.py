GENERATE_DIAGRAM_QA_PROMPT = """You are an expert in data analysis and good at asking questions about diagrams.
My persona is: "{persona}"
I want you to generate some question-answer pairs of a {figure_type} about {topic}, which I would ask.
Instead of showing the figure, I provide the data and the code that generates the figure.

Here is the data:
<data>
{data}
</data>

Here is the code that generates the figure:
<code>
{code}
</code>

Please come up with a list of *reasonable questions* that people will ask when they see the rendered figure. Here are the requirements:
1. **Question Style**: The questions must be natural and related to the figure, which can help interpret the data and understand the insights.
    (1) The questions vary in complexity. Some are easy to answer by just referring to the figure, and some are challenging and require multiple-step reasoning.
    (2) The questions should be answerable based on the *visual information* in the figure. Don't include any coding details in the questions since this type of information is not visible in the figure.

2. **Question Types**: Most questions are short-answer, but some can be multiple-choice, yes/no, or summary questions. You can use the following types:
    (1) Short-answer: At least 5 short-answer questions.
    (2) Multiple-choice: There should be at least two multiple-choice questions. The number of options can be 3, 4, 5, or more. The option labels can be different types: alphabet, Arabic numerals, or Roman numerals. The correct option should be different in each question.
    (3) Yes/No (True/False): At least 1 binary question.
    (4) Summary: At least 1 summary question that asks for describing the *entire figure* or writing a caption for the figure.
    (5) Unanswerable: At least 1 question cannot be answered based on the visual information in the figure. The answer to this question can be "Cannot be determined", "Not enough information", "I don't know", etc.

3. **Provide Explanations**: In addition to a *concise answer* for each question, provide an explanation that details the reasoning steps to reach the answer. For the summary question, the explanation is a more detailed description of the figure.

4. **Response Format**: separate the question, answer, and explanation with a | character: question | answer | explanation. The question-answer pairs should be separated by double newlines (\n\n).
For example:
what's the difference between A and B? | 15 | A is 10 and B is 25, so the difference is 25-10=15

Which group has the highest value? A. Group-1 B. Group-2 C. Group-3 | B | Group-1 is 20, Group-2 is 25, and Group-3 is 15, so Group-2 has the highest value.

</data>

<code>
{code}

Please come up with a list of *reasonable questions* that people will ask when they see the rendered diagram. Here are the requirements:
1. **Question Types**: All questions should be short-answer questions that are answerable based on the visual information in the diagram. All questions can be answered with a single word, phrase, or number. (as short as possible)
    (1) **Descriptive questions** ask for the basic information in the diagram, such as the value of a specific node, the relationship between two nodes, the number of nodes/edges, etc. Try to cover different aspects/locations in the diagram.
    (2) **Reasoning questions** require reasoning over multiple information in the diagram. These questions should be more challenging and require a deeper understanding of the diagram. Usually, you need to iterate through the flow of the diagram and combine multiple pieces of information to answer these questions.
    (3) **Diagram Type-specific questions** are questions that are specific and unique to this diagram type {figure_type}. These questions should be tailored to the content and structure of the diagram.

2. **Provide Explanations**: 
    (1) In addition to a *concise answer* (as short as possible) for each question, provide a *step-by-step explanation* that details the reasoning steps to reach the answer.
    (2) For complex reasoning questions, the explanation should be more detailed and include all the necessary steps.

3. **Response Format**: Use | to separate the question, explanation, and concise answer for each example.
    (1) Follow this format: question | explanation | concise answer, e.g., what's the output of this diagram if the input X=5? | After receiving input X=5, the next node computes X*2=10, then subtracts 3, which results in 10-3=7 | 7
    (2) Separate the question-answer pairs by double newlines (\n\n). question1 | explanation1 | answer1\n\nquestion2 | explanation2 | answer2\n\n...
    (3) Do not provide too many questions, 5-10 questions are enough. Focus on the diversity and quality of the questions with a very detailed explanation for challenging questions.
    (4) The concise answer should be as short as possible and directly answer the question. The answer should be faithful and exactly the same as what you would expect to see in the diagram, don't rephrase it. All words in the answer should be processed in natural language, no coding terms/characters.

Please follow the format strictly and do not include any additional text at the beginning or end of your response."""

1. **Style Requirements**:
    (1) Try to be creative and change the arguments (e.g., font, color, marker, etc) to make the diagram more visually appealing and informative.
    (2) Consider the **scale of data** to select the appropriate design scale (canvas size, node/edge, font/marker size, etc) to ensure all information in the diagram is clear and easy to understand, with no text overlapping etc.

2. **Code Requirements**: create a function called `generate_diagram` that generates the diagram using `graphviz` and returns the diagram as a PIL Image object.
    (1) The data, which is loaded as a dictionary is provided as the first argument for the function. The function has no other arguments. You may need to adjust the data format or hardcode some data to fit the `graphviz` API.
    (2) Remember to import necessary libraries (e.g., `import numpy as np`, `import graphviz`, etc) at the beginning of the script.
    (3) The `generate_diagram` function should save the diagram to a BytesIO and then return the diagram as a PIL Image object. **Do not close the BytesIO object.**
    (4) Only define the function and do not call it. Do not show the diagram. Save the diagram with appropriate resolution. No need to show example usage.

3. **Output Requirements**:
    Put ```python at the beginning and ``` at the end of the script to separate the code from the text. This will help me easily extract the code.

2. **Code Requirements**: You can use any LaTeX package to generate the diagram.
    (1) You need to hardcode the provided data into the LaTeX script to generate the diagram. Be careful with the syntax and formatting of the LaTeX script.
